Decklin's git-wiki
==================

Everyone needs a fork of git-wiki; here's mine. I have dispensed with
a few things in an attempt to make it even more minimal:

  * It doesn't require Rack. (But see below if you still want it.)
    git-wiki.rb reads like a naive Sinatra script and can be run from
    the command line.

  * It doesn't use a separate repository to hold the wiki; you clone
    git-wiki and then store your pages in that repo! From there,
    changes to the code can be merged from upstream or cherry-picked
    back. (You don't have to do this either; it's just the default.)

I've changed a few matters of taste, as well:

  * Page URLs are under /pages/. Instead redirecting to a "home page",
    / magically shows the contents of the page "index" (this name is
    configurable).

  * Wiki links use [[Brackets, Like This!]], and generate a link to
    (e.g.) "brackets-like-this". You *can* create a page with
    characters other than [a-z0-9-], but you won't be able to link to
    it as easily.

  * The extension for Markdown files is, by default, ".text".

  * There's a basic stylesheet included. The views themselves are more
    spartan, but since they are a part of your wiki's repository, you
    are encouraged to edit them.

And finally, I added a couple features and bug fixes:

  * You can enter a commit message when editing a page. If you don't,
    the default message only denotes that the commit was made from the
    web interface.

  * You don't have to use the branch 'master'; git-wiki always reads and
    commits to the current branch. (You may prefer to keep all your real
    pages in a branch, and have master just be a tracking branch.)

  * Page histories are viewable under /page/foo/revisions/.

Git-wiki was designed and written by Simon Rozet. He did the hard work, I
just fiddled with the chrome a bit. The original README contains a wealth
of additional information.

Installation and Use
--------------------

This git-wiki requires Sinatra, Grit, Haml, and RDiscount, all available
on RubyGems. Here's how to create a new wiki and run it:

    git clone git-wiki my-wiki
    cd my-wiki
    ./git-wiki.rb # and point browser to http://localhost:4567/

You can still run git-wiki with Rack if you want; create a trivial
config.ru (`require 'git-wiki'; run Sinatra::Application`) and then
run rackup.

Configuration
-------------

At the end of git-wiki.rb is a `configure` block (which applies to all
environments). Edit it, or copy it to your rackup script and override
the defaults. You can use this to set different wiki repositories for
development/testing/production if you want.

Caveats
-------

Because we use Grit by modifying the workdir and then calling `git
add`, git-wiki must be run with a non-bare wiki repo. If you want to
clone this repo and then push to it, you should read the [Git FAQ
entry][faq] about the perils of pushing to a repo with a checked-out
workdir.

In practice, you will hopefully never edit the workdir of the "live"
repo directly, so ensuring that receive.denyNonFastForwards is turned
on and adding a post-update hook to reset the index is a reasonable
(if not very clean) work-around.
